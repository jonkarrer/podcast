          <p>Welcome to our corner of the internet. We have created a podcast to communicate with the ordinary and flawed of the world. People, since birth, learn as they go (maybe not Elon Musk) and it is difficult to explain what is happening. Nobody seems sure, but everyone has a story. A story about their suffering, thier joy, and their truths. Our tribe seeks to embrace, challenge, and understand all perspectives. We want to help you feel more confident in your convictions, but less aggressive toward your adversary. After all, all of us are learning "As We Go". Listen here or go there. </p>
